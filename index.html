            <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>
            <p>The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California. The band consists a dynamic
                lineup featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. The band
                achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention from their future manager.
                Having extensive experience working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the band
                could succeed even further with more support, pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known record
                label.
            </p>
            <p>From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the
                Poster
                Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic attitude, solidifying
                their
                place as one of the hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
                themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. The Bees
                Knees
                are currently recording their second studio album, looking to be released in early 2024.</p>
